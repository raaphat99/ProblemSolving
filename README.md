This is where I showcase my solutions to programming challenges from platforms like Codeforces and LeetCode. Explore efficient code, and my thought process in solving a wide range of problems. In some problems, I come up with a solution. Sometimes, it is not optimal so I would get some inspiration from other solutions or the editorial. That way I think I could get better and better at problem solving.
